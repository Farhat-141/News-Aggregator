##💡 What is an API?
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols that allows different software components to communicate with each other. Developers use APIs to connect small pieces of code and build powerful, secure, and efficient applications.

Although you don't see them, APIs work behind the scenes to power much of our digital world—from displaying weather updates to sending messages, and even fetching the latest news.
